# SimpleForm - Rails forms made easy.
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/plataformatec/simple_form.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/plataformatec/simple_form)

**SimpleForm** aims to be as flexible as possible while helping you with powerful components to create
your forms. The basic goal of SimpleForm is to not touch your way of defining the layout, letting
you find the better design for your eyes. Most of the DSL was inherited from Formtastic,
which we are thankful for and should make you feel right at home.

and refers to **SimpleForm** 2.0. If you are using **SimpleForm** in the versions 1.x, you should
